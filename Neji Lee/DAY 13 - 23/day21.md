# DAY 21

# 04-02-2022

1. Yesterday I learned about Dockerfile and today I created one. Tried creating a Dockerfile yesterday but had some issues, today resolved those issues and created a Dockerfile.
2. Learned about different deployment models of cloud- cloud-based, on-premises, and Hybrid cloud. Also learned about AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and its types - General Purpose, Compute-optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized, and Accelerated Computing instances. Instances, that's what we call a virtual machine in AWS.
3. Practised some concepts in Golang.
4. Started learning Kubernetes, got to know why it is called Kubernetes, it's history. A great tool for orchestration or we can say for managing containers. Learned about it's features, pod, difference btw k8s and docker swarm and a small overview of it's architecture.
