## Kubernetes Introduction

- When your application is small then you can manage your containers manually but once you start getting more and more traffic on your application then it becomes tough to manage your application and resources manually. This is where container orchestrators comes into place. 
- Kubernetes was initially developed by google and later it was donated to CNCF. Kubernetes is a CNCF graduated project. 
- Apart from managing your resources kubernetes can do a whole bunch of other things like:
  - Providing self healing feature to your pods 
  - autoscale (depending on traffic,CPU usage and custom metrics)
  - High Availability (No downtime)
  - Service Discovery and load balancing
