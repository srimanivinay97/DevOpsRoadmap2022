# Took a 2 weeks break due to college exams,
   I thought I would be able to keep up learning, But I was wrong.
   Exam days are really frustrating and tiring.

# Completes GoLang course of TechWorldwithNana. 
- Learnt about basics of Go Language.
- Data types, variable initialization, declaration and all other things to learn while learning a new language.
- Made a ticket booking app as demonstrated in the course.
   - It allows user to enter details, recieve a message at end.
   - It's a rather simple app But It helped me to learn Go easily.

# I learnt Go in the shortest time than when I learnt Java or python.
## Really a wonderful course by Nana.
