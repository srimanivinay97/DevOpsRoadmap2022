# Day 4 progress

### Completed half of the DevOps prerequisite course from freecodecamp

- Made an account on [KodeKloud](https://kodekloud.com/) and completed 5 exercises out of 8 on Linux Basics.

- Revised linux commands that I previously learnt as well as Learnt some new commands like sudo
   - sudo is used to give root access to current user.
   - This way some commands which may not be accessible to all users can be executed.

- Learnt Much more about the vi editor, Completed the [vi-editor quiz](https://mmumshad.github.io/vi-editor-quiz/).

- Watched about Linux package managers : rpm and yum
   - The difference is that rpm does not install all dependancies that may be required. You would have to install each dependancy one by one.
   - While yum installs all dependencies automatically. 
   - yum is actually built on top of rpm.

> I don't know when I'll be use rpm of yum, but I get a taste of what's coming.

- Then I learnt about Linux services
   - they are essentially any software that runs in background.
   - Having done some web-development , web-servers can be termed as services.
   - some commands for services are
   ```systemctl start httpd
      systemctl stop httpd
      systemctl status httpd
      systemctl enable httpd
      systemctl disable httpd```

> Again, I don't know when will I use these, probably after completing basics.

- Then Came the topic of Virtual Box
   - Having watched tons of " Scammer gets destroyed " videos , This was the long lost interest topic that came by today.
   - Learning about VirtualBox, because of the ease that the topic was taught with, I was mesmerized.
   - VirtualBox is like having a computer inside of computer that is not connected with the outside computer.
      - It's connected but not connected. Interesting isn't it.
      - You can control the virtual box computer using terminal in mac with ssh login. Which was taught in earlier part of video in Linux commands.
      - Also, You can have many virtual boxes, and each box/computer will be unknown of any other box.
         - That is the reason why scammers can't do any damage to the youtubers.

   - Just like you have git log to see history of git commits, and you can reset to any previous commit.
     - Virtual Box also saves the history of computer with the help of functionality called snapshot.

that was all I learnt today , Will complete the lecture tomorrow.
