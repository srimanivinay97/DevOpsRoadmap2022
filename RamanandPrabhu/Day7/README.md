  * Linux Installation - Planning
  - A partition layout has to be decided at the time of installation because linux system handle partition by mounting them at specific points in the filesystem.
  
  /(sda1)           		home(sda2)
  
		\					/	
			Linux HD(sda)
		/					\
  var(sda3)					swap(sd4)
  
  * Installation Source
  - Like other operating systems, Linux distributions are provided on optical media such as CDs or DVDs. USB media is also a popular option. Most Linux distributions support booting a small image and downloading the rest of the system over the network; these small images are usable on media or as network boot images, making it possible to install without any local media at all.
  Many installers can do an installation completely automatically, using a configuration file to specify installation options. This file is called a Kickstart file for Fedora-based systems, an AutoYAST profile for SUSE-based systems, and a preseed file for the Debian-based systems.
