- **Computer Networking Full Course - OSI Model Deep Dive with Real Life Examples** *(Kunal Kushwaha)*:

  - *Protocols:*
    - Set of rules defined by the internet society.
  - *Port Numbers:*
    - A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.
    - 0 to 1023 *(Reserved ports)*
      - Ex: HTTP has its port number as 80.
    - 1024 to 49152 *(Application ports)*
      - Ex: SQL has its port number as 1433.
  - *Submarine Cables Map (Optical Fibre Cables):*
    - https://www.submarinecablemap.com/ 
    - This is how the whole world is connected via internet(very cool).
  - *LAN(Local Area Network), MAN(Metropolitan Are Network) & WAN(Wide Area Network):*
    - Small computer networks that are confined to a localised area are known as LANs.
    - The network that connects users across metropolitan areas or cities.
    - The networks spread across countries or on a very large geographical area are known as WANs.
  - *Router:*
    - A router is a network device that forwards data from one network to another.
  - *Topologies(BUS, RING, STAR, TREE, MESH):*
    - **BUS:**
      - The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable known as a backbone cable.
    - **RING:**
      - Ring topology is like a bus topology, but with connected ends.
      - The data flows in a single loop continuously known as an endless loop.
    - **STAR:**
      - Star topology is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the central hub, switch or a central computer.
    - **TREE:**
      - Tree topology combines the characteristics of bus topology and star topology.
      - A tree topology is a type of structure in which all the computers are connected with each other in hierarchical fashion.
    - **MESH:**
      - Mesh technology is an arrangement of the network in which computers are interconnected with each other through various redundant connections.
  - *OSI MODEL(7 Layers):*
    - Application -> Presentation -> Session -> Transport -> Network -> Data link -> Physical
    - OSI Model stands for Open System Interconnection Model.
    - **Application Layer:**
      - It's implemented in the software.
      - Users interact in this layer.
      - Example: Whatsapp,Browser etc
    - **Presentation Layer:**
      - Converts the data received from application layer to Machine Representable binary format.
      - Provides abstraction.
      - SSL protocol is used.
    - **Session Layer:**
      - The Session layer is used to establish, maintain and synchronizes the interaction between communicating devices.
    - **Transport Layer:**
      - The main responsibility of the transport layer is to transfer the data completely.
      - It receives the data from the upper layer and converts them into smaller units known as segments.
    - **Network Layer:**
      - This is where the router lives.
      - It determines the best path to move data from source to the destination based on the network conditions, the priority of service, and other factors.
    - **Data link Layer:**
      - It defines the format of the data on the network. It provides a reliable and efficient communication between two or more devices.
    - **Physical Layer:**
      - The main functionality of the physical layer is to transmit the individual bits from one node to another node.
      - It establishes, maintains and deactivates the physical connection.
  - *TCP/IP MODEL:*
    - Application -> Transport -> Network -> Data link -> Physical
  - *Client Server Architecture*
  - *Peer to Peer Architecture*
