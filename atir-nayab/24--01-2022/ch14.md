## Networking Configuration files
Network configuration files are essential to ensure that interfaces function correctly. They are located in the `/etc` directory tree. However, the exact files used have historically teen dependent on the particular Linux distribution and verison being used.

## Network Interfaces
Network interfaces are a connection channel between a device and a network. Physically, network interfaces can proceed through a network interface card (NIC).

## The Ip Utility
To view the IP address:

`/sbin/ip addr show`

To view the routing information

`/sbin/ip route show`

ip a very powerful program that can do many things. Older utilities such as ifconfig and route are often used to accomplished similar tasks.

## Ping
ping is used to check whether or not a machine attached to the network can receive and send data; i.e. it confirms that the remote host is online and is responding.

To check the status of the remote host, at the command prompt type `pint <hostname>`

## route
A network requries the connection of many nodes. Data moves from source to destination by passing through a series of routers  and potentially across multiple networks. Servers maintain routing tables containing the addresses of each node in the network. The IP routing protocols enable routers to build up a forwarding table that correlates final destinations with the next hop addresses.

## traceroute
traceroute is used to inspect the route which the data packet takes to reach the destination host, which makes it quite useful for troubleshooting network delays and errors. By using traceroute, you can isolate connectivity issues between hops, which helps resolve them faster.

## More Networking Tools
|Networking Tools|Description|
|:-:|:-:|
|ethtool|Queries network interfaces and can also set various parameters such as the speed|
|netstat|displays all active connections and routing tables; useful for monitoring performance and troubleshooting|
|nmap|Scans open ports on a network; important for security analysis|
|tcpdump|Dumps network traffic for analysis|
|iptraf|Monitors network traffic in text mode|
|mtr|Combines functionality of ping and traceroute and gives a continuously updated display|
|dig|tests DNS working, a good replacement for host and nslookup|

## Graphical and Non-graphical Browsers
Browsers are used to retrieve, transmit and explore information resources, usually on the world wide web.
The common graphical browsers used in linux are:
* Firefox
* Google chrome
* Chromium
* Konqueror
* Opera

## wget
Sometimes, you need to downlaod files and information, but a browser is not the best choice, either because you want to download multiple files and/or directories, or you want to perform the action from the command line or a script. wget is a command line utility that can capably handle the following types of downloads.
* Large file downloads
* Recursive downloads, where a web page refers to other pages and all are downlaoded at once.
* Password-required downloads
* Multiple file downloads.

to download a web page, you can simply type wget \<url>.

![wget](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/47e400802600472e68f58d081c51a252/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/wgetc8.png)

## curl
Besides downlaoding, you may want to obtain information about a URL, such as the source code being used. curl can be used form the command line or a script to read such information.

To get the contents of a web page and store it to a file, type curl -o saved.html

![curl](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/f82c5e92a716627d3623a7cb1286613d/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/curlrhel7.png)

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
When you are connected to a network, you may need to transfer files from one machine to another. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a well-known and popular method for transferring files between computers using the internet.

![FTP](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/6c4efd743bc9707314f89c414e219e88/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/LFS01_ch11_screen33.jpg)

## FTP clients
FTP clients enable you to transfer files with remote computers using the FTP protocol. These clients can be either graphical or command line tools.

Some command line FTP clients are:
* ftp
* sftp
* ncftp
* yafc (Yet Another FTP Client)

FTP has fallen into disfavor on modern systems, as it is intrincically insecure, since passwords are user credentials that can be transmitted without encryption and are thus prone to interceptions. Thus is was removed in favor of using rsync and web browser https access. As an alternative sftp is a very secure mode of connection, which uses the Secure Shell (ssh) protocol.

## SSH: Executing Commands Remotely
Secure Shell (SSH) is crytographic network protool used to secure data communication. It is also used for remote services and other secure services between two devices on the network and is very useful for administering systems which are not easily available to physically work on, but to which you have remote access.

## Copying Files securely with scp
we can also move files securely using secure copy (scp) between two networked hosts. scp uses the ssh protocol for transferring data.

To copy a local file to a remote system, at the command prompt, type scp \<localfile> \<user@remotesystem>:/home/user and press enter.

You will receive a prompt for the remote password. You can also configure scp so that it does not prompt for a password for each transfer.
