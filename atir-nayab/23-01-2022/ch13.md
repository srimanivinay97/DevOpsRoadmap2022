## sed basic operations

*you must use the -i option with care, because the action is not reversible. It is always safer to use sed without the -i option and then replace the file yourself.*

`sed s/pattern/replace_string/g file1 < file2`

eg To convert 01/02....to JAN/FEB/...
```
sed -e 's/01/JAN/' -e 's/02/FEB/' -e 's/03/MAR/' -e 's/04/APR/' -e 's/05/MAY/' \
    -e 's/06/JUN/' -e 's/07/JUL/' -e 's/08/AUG/' -e 's/09/SEP/' -e 's/10/OCT/' \
    -e 's/11/NOV/' -e 's/12/DEC/'
```

## awk
awk is used to extract and then print specific contents of a file and is often used to contruct reports.

awk has the following features:
* It is a powerful utility and interpreted programming language.
* It is used to manipulate data files, retrieving and precessing text.
* It works well with fields containing a single piece of data, essentially a column and records.

![awk](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/0969d1beca3f2106cc15d5fb77f74fc0/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/awkmint.png)

As with sed, short awk commands can be sepecified directly at the command line but a more complex script can be saved in a file that you specify using the -f option.

|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|awk 'command' file|specify a command directly at the command line|
|awk -f scriptfile file|Specify a file that contains the script to be executed|

## awk basic operations
|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|awk '{ print $0}'|print entire file|
|awk -F: '{print $1}'|Print first field (column) of every line, separated by a space|
|awk -F: '{print $1 $7 }' /etc/passwd|Print first and seventh field of every line.|

## File manipulation utilities
* sort
* uniq
* paste
* join
* split


## sort
sort is used to rearrange the lines of a text file, in either ascending or descending order according to a sort key.

|syntax|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|sort \<filename>|sort the lines in the specified file, according to the characters at the begining of each line.|
|cat file1 file2 | sort| combine the two files, then sort the lines and display the output on the terminal|
|sort -r \<filename>|sort the lines in reverse order|
|sort -k 3 \<filename>|sort the lines by the 3rd field on each instead of the begining|

when used with the -u option, sort checks for unique values after sorting the records. It is equivalent to running uniq on the output sort.

![sort](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/9d6bbb9d27f74d0472f790c684258fdf/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/sort.png)

## uniq
uniq removes duplicate consecutive lines in a text file and is useful for simplifying the text display.

Becuase uniq requires that the duplicate entries must be consecutive, one often runs sort first and then pipes the output into uniq. If sort is used with the -u option, it can do all this in one step.

To remove duplicate entries from multiple files at once, use the following command:
`sort file1 file2 | uniq > file3`
or 
`sort -u file1 file2 > file3`
to count the number of duplicate entries, use the following command.
`uniq -c filename`

## paste
paste can be used to create a single file containing all three columns. The different columns are identified based on delimiters

![paste](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/0c746d1cc41ea999719d5cdad330d97b/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/LFS01_ch12_screen27.jpg)

## using paste
paste can be used to combine fields from different files, as well as combine lines from multiple files.

`paste file1 file2`
the syntax to use a different is as follows:
`paste -d, file1 file2`
common deliminiters are 'space', 'tab', '|', 'common', etc.

## join
it is an enhanced version of paste. It first checks whether the files share common fields, such as names or phone numbers and the joins the lines in two files based on a common field.

![join](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/da3d180e87ba8b70a3312fca74ecf815/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/LFS01_ch12_screen30.jpg)

## split
split is used to break a file into equal-sized segments for easier viewing and manipulation, and is generally used on relatively large files. By default split breaks up a file into 1000 line segments. The original file remains unchanged, and a set of new files with the same name plus an added prefix is created.

![split](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/b842783bcec2180547358c235590e3f6/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/LFS01_ch012_screen31.jpg)

## using split

```
wc -l american-english
99171 american english
```

where we have used wc to report on the number or lines in the file.

`split american-english dictionary`
will split the american-english file into 100 equal-sized sedments named dictionaryxx.

## Regular expressions and search patterns
regular expressions are text string used for matching a specific pattern, or to search for a specific location, such as the start or end of a line or a word. Regualr expressions can contain both normal characters or so-called meta-characters, such as * and $.

|Search patterns|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|.(dot)|match any single character|
|a\|z|Match a or z|
|$|Match end of a line|
|^|Match the begining of a line|
|*|match preceding item 0 or more times|

## using regular expressions and search patterns
 |Command|Usage|
 |:-:|:-:|
 |a..|matches azy|
 |a.|j.|matches both br and ju|
 |..$|matches og|
 |l.*|matches lazy dog|
 |l.*y|matches lazy|
 |the.*|matches the whole sentence|

## grep
grep is extensively used as a primary text searching tool. It scans files for specified patterns and can be used with regular expressionss, as well as simple strings

|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|grep [pattern] \<filename>|search for a pattern in a file and print all matching lines|
|grep -v [pattern] \<filename>|Print all lines that do not match the pattern|
|grep [0-9] \<filename>|print the lines that contain the numbers 0 through 9|
|grep -c 3 [pattern] \<filename>|print context of lines for matching the pattern.|

## strings
strings is used to extract all printable character strings found in the file or files given as arguments. It is useful in location human readable content embeded in binary files.

`strings book1.xls | grep my_string`

![strings](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/394fc9ada7ed399b6aa5f3d93bf08f89/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/strings.png)

## tr
![tr](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/8d86fe669e95004b6b55386e5f15957b/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/trfedora.png)

tr utility is used to translate specified characters into other character or to delete them. The general syntax is as follows:

`tr [options] set1 [set2]`

The first designed set1 in the example, list the characters in the text to be replaced or removed. The second set2, lists the characters that are to be substituted for the characters listed in the first argument.

|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|tr abcd...xyz ABCD...XYZ|convert lower case to upper case|
|tr '{}' '()' < inputfile > outputfile|translate braces into paranthesis|
|echo "This is for testing" \| [:space:] '\\t' |translate white space to tabs|

## tee
tee takes the output from any command and while sending it to standard output, it also saves it to a file. In other words, it tees the output stream from the command: one stream is displayed on the standard output and the other is saved to a file.

![tee](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/afb2ed8327b3ff3ea608c1dffb16a555/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/tee.png)

## wc
wc (word count) counts the number of lines, words and characters in a file or list of files.

|Option|Description|
|:-:|:-:|
|-l|displays the number of lines|
|-c|displays the number of bytes|
|-w|displays the number of words|

## cut
cut is used for manipulating column-based files and is designed to extract specific columns. The default column separator is the tab character.
