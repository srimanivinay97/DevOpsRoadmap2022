# Network Operations

**Main Highlights**
* Explain basic networking concepts, including types of networking and addressing issues.
* configure network interfaces and use basic networking utilities such as ifconfig, ip, ping, route, and traceroute.
* Use graphical and non-graphical browsers, such as Lynx, w3m, firefox, Chrome and Epiphany.
* transfer files to and from clients and servers usign both graphical and text mode applications

## Intro to Networking
A network is a group of computers and computing devices connected together through communication channels, such as cables or wireless media.

A network is used to 
* Allow the connected devices to communicate with each other
* Enable multiple users to share devices over the network, such as music and video.
* Share and manage information across computers easily
The internet is the largest network in the world and can be called *the network of networks*

## IP Addresses
Devices attached to a network must have alleast one unique network address identifier known as IP address.

## IPv4 and IPv6
There are two different types of IP addresses available: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is older and by far the more widely used, while IPv6 is newer and is designed to get past limitations inherent in the older standard.

## Decoding IPv4 Addresses
A 323-bit IPv4 address is divided into four 8-bit sections called octets
Example:
IP address -> 172.      16.     31        46
Bit Format -> 10101100.00010000.00011111.00101110

*Octet is just another word for byte*

## Class A Network Addresses
class A addresses use the first octect of an IP address as their Net ID and use the other three octets as the host ID.

## Class B network
Class B addresses use the first two octets of the IP address as their Net ID and the last two octets as Host ID.

## class c Network addresses
Class c addresses use the first three octects of the IP address and their Net ID and the last octet as their host id.

## IP Address Allocation
Typically a range of IP addresses are requested from you internet service provider (ISP) by your organization's network administrator. Often, your choice of which class IP address you are given depends on the size of your network and expected growth needs.

## name resolution
Name resolution is used to convert numerical IP address values into a human readable format known as hostname
