# File Operations

**Main Highlihts**
* Explore the filesystem and its hierarchy
* Explain the filesystem architecture.
* Compare files and identify different file types.
* Back up and compress data.

## Introduction to Filesystems
In Linux it is ofter said "Everything is a file, or at least it is treated as such. This means whether you are dealing with normal data files and documents or with devices such as sound cards and printers, you interact with them through the same king of input/output operations. This simplifies things you open a file and perform normal operations line reading the file and writing on it.

## Filesystem Varieties
Linux supports a number of native filesystem types.
* ext3
* ext 4
* squashfs
* btrfs
if also offers implementation of filesystems used on other alien operating systems, such as those from:
* Windows(ntfs,vfat)
* SGI (xfs)
* IBM (jfs)
* MacOS(hfs, hfs+)
Many older, legacy filesystems such as FAT are also supported.
The most advanced filesystem types in common use are the journaling varieties: ext4,xfs, btrfs, and jfs. These have amny state of the art features and high performance and are very hard to corrupt accidentlly.

## Linux Partitions
Each filesystem on a Linux system occupies a disk partition. Partition help to organize the contents of disks according to the kind and use of the data contained.

## Mount Points
Before you can start using a filesystem, you need to mount it on the filesystem tree at a mount point. This is simply a directory where the filesystem is to be grafted on.

![Mount Points](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/90eea9eba0b63783a8bcf2b85ae8a9e3/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/LFS01_ch08_screen06.jpg)

*If you mount filesystem on a non-empty direcotry, the former contents of that directory are covered-up and not accessible until the filesystem is unmounted. Thus, mount points are usually empty directories.*

## Mounting and Unmounting
The mount command is used to attach a filesystem somewhere within the filesystem tree. The basic arguments are the device node and mount point.

**`sudo mount /dev/sda5 /home`**

will attach the filesystem contained in the disk partition associated with the `/dev/sda5` device node, into the filesystem tree at the `/home` mount point.

To unmount the partition
**`sudo unmount /home`**

## NFS and Network Filesystems
It is often necessary to share data across physical systems which may be either in the same location or anywhere that can be reached by the internet.

![The Client-Server Architecture of NFS](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/b29a567ddecc954ea6440a9e4dedd067/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/nfs.png)

Many system administrators mount remote users home directories on a server in order to give them access to the same files and configuration files across multiple client systems. This allows the users to log in to different computers, yet have access to the same files and resources.

The most common such filesystem is named simply NFS (the Network Filesystem)

## NFS on the Server
On the server machine, NFS uses daemons and other system servers are started at the command line by typing:

**sudo systemctl start nfs**

*On RHEL/CentOs 8, the service is called nfs-server, not nfs.*

The text file `/etc/exports` contains the directories and permissions that a host is willing to share with other systems over NFS. A very simple entry in this file may look like the following

**/projects *.example.com(rw)**

This entry allows the directory `/projects` to be mounted using NFS with read and write (rw) permissions and shared with other hosts in the example.com domain.

After modifying the `/etc/exports` file, you can type exportfs -av to notify linux about the directories you are allowing to be remotely mounted using NFS. You can also restart NFS with sudo systemctl restart nfs,

## NFS on the Client
On the client machine, if it is desired to have the remote filesystem mounted automatically uplon system boot, etc/fstab is modified to accomplish this. eg an entry in the client's `/etc/fstab` might look like the following

**servername:/projects /mnt/nfs/projects nfs default 0 0**

## Overview of User Home Directories
Each user has a home directory, usually placed under `/home`. The `/root` directory on modern Linux system is no more than the home directory of the root user.

![Home Directores](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/9817790ba352d4047027eb1d61516db5/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/Home_directories.png)

## The /bin and /sbin Directories
The `/bin` directory contains executables binaries, essentail commands used to boot the system or in single-user mode, and essentail commands requried by all system users, such as cat, cp, ls, mv, ps and rm.

Likewise the `/sbin` directory is intended for essential binaries related to system adminimistration, such as fsck and ip.

## The /proc Filesystem
Certain filesystem, like the one mounted at `/proc` are called pseudo-filesystems because they have no permanent presence anywhere on the disk.

The `/proc` filesystem contains virtual files (files that exist only in memory) that permit viewing constantly changing kernek data. `/proc` contains files and directories that mimic kernel structures and configuration information. It does not comtain real files, but runtime system information.

Some important entries in `/proc` are: 
`/proc/cpuinfo`
`proc/interrupts`
`proc/meminfo`
`proc/mounts`
`proc/partitions`
`proc/version`

## The /dev Directory
The `/dev` directory contains device nodes. a type of pseudo-file used by most hardware and software devices, except for network devices. This directory is
* Empty on the disk partition when it is not mounted.
* Contains entries which are created by the udev sytem, which creates and manages device nodes on linux, creating them dynamically when devices are found.
eg
  1. `/dev/sda1` (first partition on the first hard disk)
  1. `/dev/1p1` (second printer)
  1. `/dev/random` (a source of random numbers)

  ![The /dev Directory](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/ee00318b4e056829ec5580f3f8c6ca10/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/lsdev.png)

  ## The /var Directory
  The `/var` directory contains files that are expected to change in size and content as the system is running (var stands for variable)
  eg
    * system log files `/var/log`
    * Package and database files: `/var/lib`
    * print queues: `/var/spool`
    * Temporary files `/var/tmp`
![The /var Directory](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/2d840d9232739d72bb6a2af07308a46d/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/lsvar.png)

The `/var` directory may be put on its own filesystem so that growth of the files can be accomodated and any exploding file sizes do not fatally affect the system.
