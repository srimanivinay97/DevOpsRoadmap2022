## Question to Ask When Choosing a Distribution
Some questions worth thinking about before deciding on a distribution include: 
* what is the main function of the system
* what types of packages are important to the organization? for example, web server, word processing etc.
* How often are packages updated?
* How long is the support cycle for each release?
* Do youneed kernal customization from the vendor or a third party
* What hardware are you running on? eg: X86, ARM, PPC etc.
* Do you need long-term stability

## Linux Installation: Planning
The partition layout needs to be decided at the time of installation, it can be difficult to change later.

## Linux Installation: Software Choices

All installations include the bare minimum software for running a Linux distribution.

Most installers also provide options for adding categories of software.

All installers set up some initial security features on the new system. One basic step consists of setting the password for the superuser (root) and setting up an initial user.

## Linux Installation: Install Source

Linux, distributions are provided on removable media such as USB drivers and CDs or DVDs. Most Linux distributions also support booting a small image and downloading the rest of the system over the network.

## Linux Installation: The Process

After booting from the installation media, the media starts and asks questions about how the system should be set up. These questions are skipped if an automatic installation file is provided. Then the installation is performed.
