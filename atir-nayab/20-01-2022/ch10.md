## The /etc Directory
The `/etc` directory is the home for system configuration files. It contains no binary programs, although there are some executable scripts.eg `/etc/resolv.conf` tells the system where to go on the network to obtain host name to OP address mapping (DNS).

## The /boot directory
The `/boot` directory contains the few essential files needed to boot the system. For every alternative kernel installed on the system there are four files.
1. vmlinuz - The compressed Linux kernel, requried for booting
1. initramfs - The initial ram filesystem, requried for booting sometimes called initrd, not initramfs.
1. config - The kernel configuration file, only used for debugging nad bookkeeping.
1. System.map - kernel symbol table, only used for debugging.

The Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) files such as `/boot/grub/grub.conf` or `boot/grub2/grub2.cfg` are also found under the `/boot` directory.

## The /lib and /lib64 Directories
`/lib` contains libraries (common code shared by applications and needed for them to run) for the essential programs in `/bin` and `/sbin`. These library filenames either start with ld or lib.

## Removabale media: the /media, /run and /mnt Directories
One often uses removable media, such as USB drives, CDs and DVDs. To make the material accessible through the regular filesystem.

## Additional Directories Under /:

|Directory Name|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|/opt|Optional application software packages|
|/sys|Virtual pseudo-filesystem giving information about the system and the hardware. Can be used to alter system parameters and for debugging purposes.|
|/srv|Site-specific data served up by the system seldom used|
|/tmp|Temporary files, on some distributions erased across a reboot and/or may actually be a ramdisk in memory|
|/usr|Multi-usr applications, utilities and data|

## The /usr Directory Tree
The `/usr` directory tree contains threorrtically non-essential programs and scripts (in the sense that they should not be needed to initially boot the system)

|Directory Name|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|/usr/include|Header files used to compile applications|
|/usr/lib|Libraries for program in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin|
|/usr/lib64|64-bit libraries for 64-bit programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin|
|/usr/sbin|Non-essential system binaries, such as system daemons|
|/usr/share|Shared data used by applications, generally architecture-independent|
|/usr/src|Source code, usually for the linux kernel|
|/usr/local|Data and programs specific to the local machine, subdirectories include bin, sbin, lib, share,include etc.|
|/usr/bin|This is the primary directory of executable commands on the system|

## Comparing Fies with diff
diff is used to compare files and directories. This often-used utility program has many useful options

|diff Options|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|-c|Provides a listing of differences that include three lines of context before and after the lines differing in content|
|-r|Used to recursively compare subdirectories, as well as the current directory|
|-i|Ignore the case of letters|
|-w|Ignore differences in spaces and tabs(while space)|
|-q|Be quiet: only report if files are different without listing the differences|

**diff [options] <filename1> <filename2>**
*diff is meant to be used for text files; for binary files, one can use cmp.*

## Using diff3 and patch
You can compare three files at once using diff3, which used one file as the reference basis for the other two.

**diff3 MY-FILE COMMON-FILE YOUR-FILE**

## Using the file Utility
In Linux, a file's extension often does not categorize it the way it might in other operating systems. One cannot assume that a file named file.txt is a text file and not an executable program.

![Using the file Utility](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/6bc751d9dafe1a200e66f2eb4479db0e/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/fileu1910.png)

## Patch
Linux and other open source communitities often use the patch utility to disseminate modifications and updates.

## Backing Up Data
There are many ways you can back up data or even your entire system. Basic ways to do so include the use of simple copying with cp and use of the more robust rsync.

Both can be used to synchronize entire directory trees. However, rsync is more efficient, because it checks if the file being copied already exists. If the file exists and there is no change in size or modification time, rync will avoid an unnecessary copy and save time. Furthermore, because rsync copies only the parts of the files that have actually changed, it can be very fast.

cp can only copy files to and from destination on the local machine, but rsync can also be used to copy files from one machine to another. Locations are designated in target:path from, where target can be in the form of someone@host.

Using the -r option to recusively walk down the directory tree copying all files and directories below.

## Using rsync
rsync is a very powerful utility.

**rsync -r project-X archive-machine:archives/project-X**

A good combination of options is shown in:
**rsync --progress -avrxH --delete sourcedir destdir**

## Comptessign Data
File data is often compressed to save disk space and reduce the time it takes to transmit files over networks.

|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|gzip|The most frequently used Linux compression utility|
|bzip2|Produces files significantly smaller than those produced by gzip|
|xz|the mose space efficient compression utility used in linux|
|zip|is often required to examine and decompress archives form other operating systems|

In addition, tar utility is often used to group files in an archive and then compress the whole archive at once.

## Compressing Data Using gzip
gzip is the most often used linux compression utility. It compresses very will and is very fast.

|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|gzip *|Compresses all files in the current directory; each file is compressed and renamed with a .gz extension|
|gzip -r projectX|Compresses all files in the projectX directory, along with all files in all of the directories under projectX|
|gunzip foo|De-compresses foo found in the file foo.gz. Under the hood, the gunzip command is actually the same as gzip -d.|

## Compressing Data using bzip2
bzip2 has a syntax that is similar ot gzip but it uses a different compression algorithm and produces significantly smaller files, at the price of taking a longer time to do its work.

|bzip2 *|Compresses all of the files in the current directory and replaces each file with a file renamed with a .bz2 extension.|
|:-:|:-:|
|bunzip2|Decompresses all of the files with an extension of .bz2 in the current directory. Under the hood, bunzip2 is the same as calling bzip2 -d|

*bzip2 has lately become deprecated due to lack of maintenance and the superior compression ratios of xz which is actively maintained.*

## Compressing Data using xz
xz is the most space efficient compression utility used in Linux and is used to store archives of the Linux kernel. Once again, it trades a slower compression speed for an even higher compression ratio.

|Comamnd|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|xz *|Compresses all of the files in the current directory and replaces each file with one with a .xz extension|
|xz foo|Compresses foo into foo.xz using the default compression level (-6) and removes foo if compression succeeds.|
|xz -dk bar.xz|Decompresses bar.xz into bar and does not remove bar.xz even if decompression is successful.|
|xz -dcf a.txt b.txt.xz > abcd.txt|Decompresses a mix of compressed and uncompressed files to standard output, using a single command.|
|xz -d *.xz|Decompresses the files compressed using xz.|

## handling Files Using zip
The zip program is not often used to compress files in Linux, but is often required to examine and decompress archives from other operating systems. It is a legacy program

|Comamnd|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|zip backup *|Compresses all files in the current directory and places them in the backup.zip|
|zip -r backup.zip ~|Archives your login directory (~) and all files and directories under it in backup.zip|
|zip -r backup.zip ~|Archives you login directory (~) and all files and directory under it in backup.zip|
|unzip backup.zip|Extracts all files in backup.zip and places them in the current directory.|

## Archiving and Compressing Data Using tar
Historically tar stood for tape archive and was used to archive files to a magnetic tape. It allows you to create or extract files from an archive file, often called a tarball. At the same time, you can optionally compress while creating the archive, anddecompresee while extracting its contents
|Comamnd|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|tar xvf mydir.tar|Extract all the files in mydir.tar into the mydir directory|
|tar zvcf mydir.tar.gz|create the archive and compress with gzip|
|tar jcvf mydir.tar.bz2 mydir|Create the archive and compress with bz2|
|tar Jcvf mydir.tar.xz|Create the archive and compress with xz|
|tar xvf mydir.tar.gz|Extract all the files in mydir.tar.gz into the mydir directory.|

## Disk-to-Disk copying (dd)
The dd program is very useful for making copies of raw disk space. For example to backup your Master Boot Record (MBR)

**dd if=/dev/sda of=sda.mbr bs=512 count=1**
