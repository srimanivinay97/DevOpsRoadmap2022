## User startup files
The command shell program uses one or more startup files to configure the user environment. Files in the `/etc` directory define global settings for all users, while initialization files in the user's home directory can include and/or overrride the global settings

## Order of the startup files
The standard prescription is that when you first login to linux, /etc/procfile is read and evaluated, after which the following files are searched in the listed order:
1. ~/.bash_profile
1. ~/.bash_login
1. ~/.profile
