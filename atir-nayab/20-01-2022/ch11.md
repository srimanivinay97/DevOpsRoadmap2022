## Creating Files without using an editor
If you want to create a file without using an editor, there are two standard ways to create one from the command line and fill it with current

The first is to use echo repeatedly.
`echo line one > myfile`
`echo line two >> myfile`
`echo line three >> myfile`

*greater-than (>) will send the output of a command to a file, two of them (>>) will append the new output to an existing file*

The second way is to use cat combined with direction
```
cat << EOF > myfile
line one
line two
line three
EOF
```

Both techniques produce a file with the following lines in it

## nano 
nano is easy to use, and requires very little effort to learn. To open a file, type nano < filename > and press Enter.

nano provides a two line shortcut bar at the bottom of the screen that lists the available commands.

## gedit
it is a simple to use graphical editor that can only run within a graphical desktop environment. It is visually quite similar to the notepad text editor in windows

`gedit <filename>`

## vi and emacs
Both vi and emacs have a basic purely text-based form that can run in non-graphical environnent. They also have one or more graphical interface forms with extended capabilities.
