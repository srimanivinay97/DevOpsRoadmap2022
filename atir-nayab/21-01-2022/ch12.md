## Creating Aliases
You can create customized commands or modify the behavior of already existing ones by creating aliases. Most often, these aliases are placed in your `~/.bashrc` file so they are available to any command shells you create unalias removes an alias.

## Basics of Users and Groups
All Linux users are assigned a unique user ID (uid), which is just an integer; normal users start with a uid of 1000 or greater.

Linux uses groups for organizing users. Groups are collection of accounts with certain shared permissions. Control of group membership is administered through the `/etc/group` file. which shows a list of groups and their members. By default every user belongs to a default or primary group.

Users also have one or more group IDs (gid), including a default one which is the same as user ID. These numbers are associated with names through the files `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`.

## Adding and Removing Users
Adding a new user is done with useradd and removing an existing user is done with userde1. In the simplest form, an account for the new user bjmoose would be done with:

**sudo useradd bjmoose**

which by default, sets the home directory to `/home/bjmoose` populates  it with some basic files (copied from `/etc/ske1`) and adds a line to `/etc/passwd` such as

`bjmoose:x:1002:1002::/home/bjmoose:bin/bash`

and sets the default shell to `/bin/bash`. Removing a user account is as easy as typing userdel bjmoose.

## Adding and Removing Groups
Adding a new group is done with groupadd:

`sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd anewgroup`

the group can be removed with:

`sudo /usr/sbin/groupdel anewgroup`

Adding a user to an already group is done with usermod.

`groups rjsquirrel`
`bjmoose : rjsquirrel`

and then add the new group

`sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -a -G anewgroup rjsquirrel`
`groups rjsquirrel`
`rjsquirrel: rjsquirrel anewgroup`

These utilities update `/etc/group` as necessary. Make sure to use the -a option, for append, so as to avoid removing already existing groups. groupmod can be used to change group properties, such as the Group ID (gid) with the -g option or its name with then -n option.

Removing a user from the group is somewhat trickier. The -G option to usermod must give a complete list of groups. Thus is you do:

`sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -G rjsquirrel rjsquirrel`
`groups rjsquirrel`
`sjsquirrel : rjsquirrel`

ont the rjsquirrel group will be left

## The root Account
The root account is very powerful and has full access to the system. Other opertaing systems often call thsi the administrator account; in linux if is often called the superuser account.

You can use sudo to assign more limited privilieges to user accounts:
* Only on a temprary basis.
* Only for a specific subset of commands.

## su and sudo
when assigning elevated privileges, you can use the command su (switch or substitute user) to launch a new shell running as another user. It is almost always a bad practise to use su to become root. Resulting errors can include deletion of vital files from the system and security breaches.

Granting privileges using sudo is less dangerous and is preferred. By default sudo must be enabled on a per-user basis

## Environment Variables
Environment variables are quantities that have specific values which may be utilized by the command shell, such as bash or other utilities and applications. Some environment variables are given preset values by the system.

![Environment](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/1604db32728f9bb80765461155886f79/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/envsetexport.png)

## Setting Environment Variables
By default, variables created within a script are only available to the current shell; child processes (sub-shells) will not have access to values that have been set or modified.

|task|Command|
|:-:|:-:|
|Show the value of a specific variable|echo $SHELL|
|export a new variable value|export VARIABLE=value (or VARIABLE=value; export VARIABLE)|
|add a variable|Edit `~/.bashrs` and the line `export VARIABLE=value`|
