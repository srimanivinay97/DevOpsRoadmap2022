## Setting Environment Variables
By default, variables created within a script are only avaible to the current shell; child processes (sub-shells) will not have access to values that have been set or modified.
Allowing child processes to see the values requires use of the export command.

|Task|Command|
|:-:|:-:|
|Show the value of a specific variables|echo $SHELL|
|Export a new variable value|export VARIABLE=value (or VARIABLE=value; export VARIABLE)|
|Add a variable permanently|Edit `~/.bashrc` and add the line export VARIABLE=value    Type source ~/.bashrc or just . ~/.bashrc (dot ~/.bashrc); or just start a new shell by typing bash|

## The HOME Variable
Home is an environment variable that represents the home (or login) directory of the user. cd without arguments will change the current working directory to the value of HOME. 

`cd $HOME` and `cd ~` are completely equivalent statements.

|Command|Explanation|
|:-:|:-:|
|`echo $HOME`|show the value of the HOME environment variable|
|pwd|where are we? Use print working directory to find out|
|cd|Change directory|
|pwd|...takes us back to HOME, as you can now see|

## The PATH Variable
PATH is an ordered list of directories (the path) which is scanned when a command is given to find to appropriate program or script to run. Each directory in path is separated by colons(:). A null (empty) directory name (or ./) indicates the current directory at any given time.

* :path1:path2 - null directory defore the first colon (:)
* path1::path2 - null directory between path1 and path2

## The SHELL Variable
The environment variable SHELL point to the user's default command shell and contains the full pathname to the shell.

## The PS1 Variable and the command line prompt
Prompt statement (PS) is used to customize your prompt string in your terminal windows to display the information you want.

PS1 is the primary prompt variable which controls what your command line prompt look like. The following special characters can be included in PS1.

`\u` - User name
`\h` - Host name
`\w` - Current working directory
`!` - History number of this comand
`\d` - Date

They must be surrounded in single quotes when they are used.

## Recalling Previous Commands
bash keeps track of previously entered commands and statements in a history buffer. You can recall previously used commands simply by using the up and down cursor keys. The information is stored in `~/.bash_history`. If you have multiple terminals open, the commands typed in each session are not saved until the session terminates.

## Using history environment variables
* HISTFILE
  The location of the history file.
* HISTFILESIZE
  The maximum number of lines in the history file(default 500)
* HISTSIZE
  The maximum number of commands in the history file.
* HISTCONTROL
  How commands are stored
* HISTIGNORE
  which command line can be unsaved

## Executing Previous Commands
|Syntax|Task|
|:-:|:-:|
|!|Start a history substitution|
|!$|Refer to the last argument in a line|
|!n|Refer to the nth command line|

|CTRL-W|Deletes the word before the cursor|
|CTRL-U|Deletes from begining of line to cursor position|
|CTRL-E|goes to the end of the line|
|TAB|Auto-completes fies, directories, and binaries|

## File Ownership
In Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems, every file associated with a user who is the owner. Every file is also associated with a group which has an interest in the filea and certain rights, or permissions: read, write, and execute.

|command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|chown|used to change user ownership of a file or directory|
|chgrp|used to change group ownership|
|chmod|used to change the permissions on the file, which can be done separately for owner, group and the rest of the world|

## File Permission Modes and chmod
Files have three kinds of permissions: read (r), write(w), execute(x). These are generally represented as in rwx. These permissions affect three groups of owner: user/owner(u), group(g), and others(o).

As a result you have the following three groups of three permissions:

rwx:  rwx:  rwx
u:    g:    o

There are a number of different ways to use chmod.
```
ls -l somefile
-rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 1601 Mar 9 15:04 somefile
chmod uo+x,g-w somefile
ls -l somefile
-rwxr--r-x 1 student student 1601 Mar 9 15:04 somefile
```

where u stands for user (owner), o stands for other(world), and g stands for group.

* 4 if read permission is desired
* 2 if write permission is desired
* 1 if execute permission is desired
Thus, 7 means read/write/execute, 6 means read/write, and 5 means read/execute

When you apply this to the chmod command, you have to give three digits for each degree of freedom

```
chmod 755 somefile
ls -l somefile
```
