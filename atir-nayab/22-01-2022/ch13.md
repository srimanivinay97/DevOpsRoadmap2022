# Manipulating Text

**Main Highlights**
* Display and append to file contents using cat and echo
* Edit and print file contents using sed and awk.
* Search for patterns using grep.
* Use multiple other utilities for file and text manipulation

## Command Line Tools for manipulating Test files
![command line tool for manipulating text files](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/1003ad62cadceacd75a659e16ec77873/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/cmdlinetext.png)

## cat
cat is short concatenate. It is often used to read and print files, as well as for simply viewing file contents.
`cat <filename>`

the tac command prints the lines of a file in reverse order.

|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|cat file1 file2|Concatenate multiple files and display the output; i.e. the entire content of the first is followed by that of the second file|
|cat file1 file2 > newfile|Combine multiple files and save the output into a new file|
|cat file >> axistingfile|Append a file to the end of an existing file|
|cat > file|Any subsequent lines typed will go into the file, until CTRL-D is typed|
|cat >> file|Any subsequent lines are appended to the file, until CTRL-D is typed.|

## Using cat interactively
![using cat](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/2186f2162bb7f8d6f7fac9004f7d4784/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/cateoffedora.png)

Another war to create a file at the terminal is `cat> <filename> <<EOF`. A new file is created and you can type the requried input. To, exit enter EOF at the begining of a line.

*EOF is case sensitive. One can also use another word, such as STOP*

## echo
echo simply displays text. 

`echo string`

echo can be used to display a string on standard output or to place in a new file (using the > operator) or append to an already existing file (using the >> operator).

The -e option, along with the following switches, is used to enable special character sequences, such as the newline character or horizontal tab.
* \n represents newline
* \t represents horizontal tab.

echo is particularly useful for viewing the values of environment variables

|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|echo string > newfile|The specified string is placed in a new file|
|echo string >> existringfile|The specified string is appended to the end of an already existing file|
|echo $variable|the contents of the specified environment variable are displayed|

## Working with Large Files
Viewing somefile can be done by typing either of the two following commands
```
less somefile
cat somefile | less
```

By default man pages are sent through the less command. You may have encountered the older more utility which has the same basic function but fewer capabilities i.e. less is more!

## head
head reads the first few lines of each named file (10 by default) and displays it on standard output.

eg
`head -n 5 /etc/default/grub`
you cal also just say:
`head -5 /etc/defaultgrub`

## tail
tail prints the last few lines of each name file and displays the last 10 lines.
tail is especially useful when you are troubleshooting any issue using log fiiles, as you probably want to see the most recent line of output.

## Viewing compressed files
When working working with compresses files, many standard commands cannot be used directly. For many commonly-used file and text manipulation programs, there is also a version especially designed to work directly with compressed files. These associated utilities have the letter 'z' prefixed to their name. For example we have utility programs such as zcat, zless, zdiff, and zgrep

|Command|Description|
|:-:|:-:|
|zcat compressed-file.txt.gz|to veiw a compressed file|
|zless somefile.gz or zmore somefile.gz|to page through a compresses file|
|zgrep -i less somefile.gz|to search inside a compresses file|
|zdiff file1.txt.gz|to search inside a compresses file|
|zdiff file1.txt.gz file2.txt.gz|to compare two compresses files|

*if you run zless on an uncomresses file, it will still work and ignore the decompression stage. *
*There are also quivalent utility programs for other compression methods besides gzip, for example we have bzcat and bzless associated with bzip2 and xzcat and xzless associated with xz.*

## sed and awk
It is very common to create and then repeatedly edit and/or extract contents from a file. Let's learn how to use sed and awk to easily perform such operations.

## sed
It is a powerful text processing tool and is one of the oldest, earliest and most popular UNIX utilities. It is used to modify the contents of a file or input stream, usually placing the contents into a new file or output stream. 

![sed](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/64bebc2555b3777d251a871e72e873d7/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+2T2021+type@asset+block/LFS01_ch12_screen_13.jpg)

sed can filter text as well as perform susbtitutions in data streams.

Data from an input source/file (or stream) is taken and moved to wroking space. The entire list of operations/modifications is applied over the data in the working space and the final contents are moved to the standard output space (or stream).

## sed command syntax
|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|sed -e command \<filename>|specify editing commands at the command line, operate on file and put the output on standard out.|
|sed -f scripfile \<filename>|specify a scriptfile containing sed commands operate on file and put output on standard out|
|echo "I hate you" \| sed s/hate/love|use sed to filter standard input, putting output on standard out.|

## sed basic operations
We can perform multiple editing and filtering operations with sed.
|Command|Usage|
|:-:|:-:|
|sed s/pattern/replace_string/file|substitute first string occurence in every line|
|sed s/pattern/replace_string/g|substitute all string occurences in every line|
|sed 1,3s/pattern/replace_string/g file| susbstitute all string occurences in a range of lines|
|||
|sed -i s/pattern/replace_string/g file|save chages for string substitution in the same file|
