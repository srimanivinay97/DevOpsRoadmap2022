## AWS for Government
**What is Public Sector?** <br/>
Public sectors include public goods and governmental services such as:

- military
- public education
- law enforcement
- health care
- infrastructure
- the government itself
- public transit

AWS can be utilized by public sector or organizations developing cloud workloakds for the public sector.

AWS achieves this by meeting regulatory compliance programs along with the specific governance and security controls.

AWS has special regions for US regulation called GovCloud

### GovCloud (US)
**Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)** A US government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

**What is GovCloud?**
A Cloud Service Provider (CSP) generally will offer an isolated region to run FedRAMP workloads.

AWS GovCloud Regions allows customers to host sensiticve Controleed Unclassified Information and other tyoes of regulated workloads.
- GovCloud Regions are only operated by employess who are U.S. citizends, U.S. soil.
- They are only accessible to U.S. entities and root accound holders who pass a screening process

Customers can architect secure cloud solutions that comply with:
- FedRAMP High baseline
- DOJ's Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) Security Policy
- U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
- Export Administration Regulation (EAR)
- Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Sercurity Requirements Guide

### Sustainability
AWS Cloud's Sustainability goals are composed of three parts:
1. **Renewable Energy** <br/>
  AWS is working towards having their AWS Global Infrastructur powered by 100% renewableenergy by 2025.
  
  AWS purchases and retires environmental attributes to cover the non-renewable energy for AWS Globaal Infrastructure:
  - Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)
  - Gurantee of Orgin (GOs)
  
2. **Cloud Efficiency** <br/>
  AWS's Infrastructure is 3.6 times more energy thsn thr median of U.S. enterprise data centers surveyed.
  
3. **Water Stewardship** <br/>
  Direct evaporate technology to cool our data center. <br/>
  Use of non-portable water for cooling purposes (recycled water) <br/>
  On-site water treatment allows us to remoce scale-forming minerals and reuse water for more cycle. <br/>
Water efficient metrics determings and monitor optimal water use for each AWS region.
